## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My Name is LovelyZeeiam, Zeeiam for short. I like to program something as I like. My initial goal of learning programming is to fully write a game like Minecraft, which is the reason why I picked up `Java` as my first language, although nowadays, Java is not such a capable language to code a game.

I also learnt `Vue` for a respondable webview to write UI. But currently I'm still working on my initial goal, i.e., code a Minecraft and play it. Publishing articles in Bilibili, I write it to also help others holding the same goal as I always do.

###### can also make musics~

## Language

- Java `(good at it)`
- Vue `(kind of good at it)`
- C++ `(learning)`
