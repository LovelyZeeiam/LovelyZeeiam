## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My Name is LovelyZeeiam, Zeeiam for short. I like to program something as I like. My initial goal of learning programming is to fully write a game like Minecraft, which is the reason why I picked up `Java` as my first language, although nowadays, Java is not such a capable language to code a game.

However, multiple reasons and hobbies keep me away from coding with no worries, recalling me back to those days when there was nothing to do but code CraftGame for the whole day.

## Language

- Java `(good at it)`
- Vue `(kind of good at it)`
- Rust `(maybe good at it)`
- C `(But seldom use)`

## Projects
